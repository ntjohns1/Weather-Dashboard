## Description

A weather dashboard that displays current and future weather info based on a user search. The frontend was built using bootstrap, with some custom CSS for hiding empty elements and displaying the background color of the UV Index element dynamically based on the value. The app uses Open Weather's One Call API and their geolocation API to accomplish the search functionality.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Current Weather API
