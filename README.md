# Weather-Dashboard

A weather dashboard that displays current and future weather info based on a user search. I built the style elements with bootstrap, with some custom styling for hiding empty elements and displaying a background color based on the UVI index value. I used Open Weather's One Call API and their geolocation API to accomplish the search functionality for the assignment. I got the text for the city names in the search history buttons rather than getting it directly from the search input field, since the API's search engine is limited to a particular format from what I could tell. I learned a lot about using for loops to iterate over DOM elements for this assignment. I found it particularly challenging working with a dynamically generated array to send data to local storage. If I have more time to work on this assignment I will clean up the UI a bit and spend some time learning how to make my code more clear and efficient by using parameters to pass values between functions.
